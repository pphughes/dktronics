Gerber files for new PCB for ZX Spectrum DK Tronics keyboard (large space bar version)

A few years back, I purchased a DK Tronics keyboard for the ZX Spectrum and set about restoring it, by unsoldering the keys and giving them a good clean.
Unfortunately, the solder tracks were corroded and started to separate from the board, rendering the PCB pretty much useless.

I'm by no way any expert in electronics, but wondered how difficult it could be to remanufacture the PCB, as it's pretty simple. I'd never done anything like this before,
so started by scanning the board and using it as a background image in Sprint Layout to re-design the PCB.

I submitted the files to JLCPCB and hoped for the best. Amazingly, they were the correct size, and afetr soldering the switches back in, everything worked!

I therefore thought I'd share these files should anyone find that they need a new PCB for the same model of DK Tronics keyboard.
